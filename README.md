# Rotten_Fruit_Detection

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive method for assessing fruit decay using a combination of computer vision and microwave technologies. The aim is to ensure the quality of fruits by accurately detecting both external and internal decay, thus reducing food wastage and economic losses.


## Abstract
The project aims to create a reliable and non-destructive method for fruit decay assessment by integrating computer vision for external decay detection and microwave technology for internal decay assessment.

### Importance of Fruit Quality Assessment
- Ensuring fruit quality is essential in the food industry to prevent spoilage and ensure consumer satisfaction.

### Challenges in Assessing Fruit Decay
- Current methods often lack accuracy and efficiency, leading to significant economic losses and food wastage.

### Proposed Methodology
- **Two-Step Approach**: Initial external decay assessment using computer vision, followed by internal decay detection using microwave technology.

## Methodology

### Computer Vision in Fruit Assessment
- **Explanation**: Computer vision techniques are employed to detect visible external decay, such as discoloration, bruises, and blemishes..
- **Software Requirements**: Python IDLE, Jupyter Notebook.

### Microwave Technology in Fruit Assessment
- **Explanation**: Microwave technology provides non-destructive internal decay detection by analyzing dielectric properties, moisture content, and texture.
- **Hardware Requirements**: Dielectric Probe Kit, Network Analyzer, 3-D Printed Conveyor Belt Prototype.
- **Software Requirements**: HFSS, Ansys.

## Project Planning
1. Curation of a database for dielectric properties of fresh and rotten fruits.
2. Testing and training deep learning models for classification.
3. Fusion of internal and external decay assessment methods.

### Software
- Python IDLE
- Jupyter Notebook
- HFSS
- Ansys
