## Project Overview

This project investigates how Virtual Reality (VR) gaming influences cognitive processes by analyzing the P300 brain wave, a marker associated with attention, memory, and decision-making. By examining variations in the P300 signals during VR gameplay, we aim to understand the cognitive impact and explore the potential of neurofeedback applications to enhance cognitive performance in virtual environments.

## Objective

To analyze the amplitude and latency of P300 brain waves during VR gaming sessions to understand the influence on cognitive engagement, attention, memory, and decision-making processes.

## Literature Survey

The project builds on several key studies:
- **Guger et al. (2018)**: Examined VR's impact on cognitive engagement and P300 brain waves.
- **Rizzo et al. (2020)**: Explored neurofeedback applications in VR to enhance cognitive performance.
- **Lee et al. (2019)**: Investigated the role of game complexity in eliciting cognitive responses.
- **Zheng et al. (2021)**: Analyzed the impact of individual differences on P300 responses during VR gameplay.

These studies provide valuable insights for optimizing VR experiences and designing engaging content.

## Methodology

1. **VR Game Development**: A VR game was designed to target cognitive processes, ensuring immersive experiences and cognitive challenges.
2. **Participant Recruitment**: Participants were selected based on age, gender, and gaming experience. Informed consent was obtained.
3. **Baseline Assessments**: Cognitive assessments were administered before VR sessions using validated tools.
4. **Data Collection**: VR sessions were conducted in a controlled environment using high-density EEG and eye-tracking to collect data on P300 brainwave activity.
5. **Data Analysis**: EEG and eye-tracking data were preprocessed, followed by machine learning analysis to predict cognitive states.
6. **Results Interpretation**: Findings were interpreted within a cognitive neuroscience framework, with practical implications for enhancing VR experiences.

## Results

- **Attention Span**: Gamers exhibited shorter attention spans and faster transitions between focused, unfocused, and drowsy states.
- **Cognitive Risks**: The gaming group showed an increased risk of conditions such as ADHD and dyslexia.
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic regression was employed to classify and predict cognitive state transitions, providing statistical evidence of the observed differences.
